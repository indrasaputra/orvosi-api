## Description

Orvosi API provides HTTP REST API for Orvosi application.
This project was previously placed in [https://github.com/orvosi/api](https://github.com/orvosi/api) which I own.

- Install PostgreSQL

    Follow [PostgreSQL installation guideline](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

- Go to project folder

    Usually, it would be `cd go/src/github.com/indrasaputra/orvosi-api`.

- Run the database

    - Make sure to run PostgreSQL.

- Fill in the environment variables

    Copy the sample env file.
    ```
    cp env.sample .env
    ```
    Then, fill the values according to your setting in `.env` file.

- Download the dependencies

    ```
